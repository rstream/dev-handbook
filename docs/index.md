# My development and system administration handbook

When you are working in multiple areas - risks of forgetting things that are not used daily is pretty high.  
That's why i've created this handbook - to keep the knowledge in a place with easy access, so I can quickly get here if I need something to recall.

Generally it's about:
* [Development](development/index.md) - development tricks, config, new language specs
* [Code editors](editors/index.md) - setup and usage of popular code editors
* [Operating systems](operating%20systems/index.md) Linux (and not only) setup and usage

...and other things you are not using so often to keep in your RAM :)

I did it for myself, but would be glad if you find it useful!
