# My development and system administration handbook

When you are working in multiple areas - risks of forgetting things that are not used daily are pretty high.  
That's why I've created this handbook - to keep the knowledge in a place with easy access, so I can quickly get here if I need something to recall.

Generally it's about:

## Development

### Desktop development

Development of desktop applications (non-web)

[C++](development/desktop/cpp/index.md) - C++ development (including Qt)  
[Java](development/desktop/java/index.md) - Java development  
[Assembler](development/desktop/assembler/index.md) - Assembler development for MS-DOS

### Web development

Development of web applications (client and server side)

[JavaScript](development/web/javascript/index.md) - JavaScript  
[NodeJS](development/web/nodejs/index.md) - NodeJS development  
[Alpine](development/web/alpine/index.md) - AlpineJS development  
[Webpack](development/web/webpack/index.md) - Webpack

## Code editors

Setup and tweaks of popular (my favorite) code editors.

[KATE](editors/kate/index.md) - very cute, but sometimes not obvious code editor  
[Visual Studio Code](editors/vscode/index.md) - one of the most popular code editors

## Operating systems

[Linux](operating-systems/linux/index.md) - Linux installation, setup, apps  
[Windows](operating-systems/windows/index.md) - Windows apps and tricks

I did it for myself, but would be glad if you find it useful!
